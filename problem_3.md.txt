A good algorithm to rearrange array elements as two numbers but not using any sorting funciton is merge sort. The first step is to use merge sort to sort the 
array as descending ordered. The time complexity for merge sort is O(nlog(n)). Then, I set two lists from the sorted list. Later, 
using two for loops to create two string. Last, return these two strings as integes.
Time complexity: O(nlog(n)). merge sort O(nlog(n)), two for loops O(2n). The total complexity is O(nlog(n) + 2n) = O(n (2+log(n))) --> O(nlog(n)).
Space complexity: O(n). For the merge sort, the worst space complexity is O(n). Inside the rearrage_digits function the space complexity is O(1). combining these two, the total worst space complexity is O(n).
